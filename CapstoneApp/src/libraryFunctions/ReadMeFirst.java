	 * Library Functions
	 * 
	 * This lab is “problem oriented”. It contains a problem/solution scenario.
	 * 
	 * Use all your programming skills to implement the scenario. This course
	 * continues your understanding of programming AND introduces coding.
	 * 
	 * You should be able to read or listen to your user’s needs and, from them,
	 * begin to synthesize the requirement and features. [the scope of this course
	 * does not include implementing multiple requirements using multiple classes.]
	 * 
	 * From the requirement and features you should be able to create a single class
	 * diagram for a class that fulfills the requirement. From that class diagram,
	 * you should be able to complete a class design with commented stubs to create
	 * a framework from which you can build a solution. The stubs should clearly
	 * demonstrate your understanding of encapsulation – each method does one
	 * ‘thing’, and only one ‘thing’.
	 * 
	 * Once the design is complete, you should complete the coding that will
	 * implement your design. There are three basic programming structures:
	 * sequence, decisions, and loops. This project allows you to demonstrate your
	 * mastery of sequence, decision, and loops, properly encapsulated, into a
	 * maintainable application.
	 * 
	 * Virtually all modern programming languages include Library Functions. Library
	 * Functions are standardized functions which carry out various, frequently
	 * needed, useful tasks. Library Functions would include input and output
	 * operations, manipulating strings, math operations, and more.
	 * 
	 * Although, throughout your professional career, you will probably never need
	 * to write any of these Library Functions, it can be very valuable to
	 * understand how they are implemented. As we have learned, maintaining programs
	 * is a significant part of software development. Many of the programs that
	 * require maintenance were written before the Library Functions were available
	 * which means you may have to maintain these often-used solutions. Also,
	 * frequently, you will have to implement some modification on a traditional
	 * Library Function. It is important to understand how these Library Functions
	 * work.
	 * 
	 * Therefore, to demonstrate your software development skills, you will design
	 * and create several Library Functions.
